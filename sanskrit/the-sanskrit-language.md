# Some Peculiarities of The Sanskrit Language

## Phonology

The Sanskrit language, like any other natural language, has for its irreducible units a series of articulable sounds. These can be represented by a series of abstract graphic symbols. There are various systems of such symbols \(scripts\), but the one with which we will be chiefly concerned is known as the devanagari \(or nagari\) lipi \(script\), the vehicle of the overwhelming majority of printed Sanskrit texts.

There are two interesting features of this script and the phonetic system of Sanskrit that make them in some ways easier to learn and memorize than English and its use of the roman script. The first of these features is that in the devaniigari script, there is a one to one correspondence between each distinct graphic symbol and a unique phonetic symbol. Thus, each "letter" of the script corresponds to one and only one sound. Compare English and its roman script where, for example, the symbol "a" may indicate many sounds, and where the symbols "c" and "s" may indicate the same sound.

The second and more significant of the features of the Sanskrit phonetic \(and graphic\) system is the fact that it is unique among all the world's languages \(with the exception of those languages whose systems are derived from Sanskrit\) in having its sounds \(and by 1.1 necessarily its script\) systematically arranged on a scientific basis.

The Sanskrit phonetic system, then, consists of some fortynine discrete sounds, represented by an equal number of discrete symbols.

## Sandhi

Perhaps the most peculiar, and initially dismaying, feature of Sanskrit is its complex system of conditional phonological change known as sandhi, or combination. Various kinds of environmentally conditioned change occur in all languages, but no other has so formalized and systematized them as has Sanskrit.

There are two basic applications of the sandhi rules, depending on the circumstances under which the sound changes occur. Many of the same rules hold for both applications. The first historically and morphologically more significant application applies to the junctures of the morphemes, or meaningful parts of words. This is called internal sandhi.

Less, perhaps, in historical significance, but of greater importance for the beginner, is the external sandhi, which occurs at word boundaries and between members of compounds. Without familiarity with the rules of external sandhi, it is impossible to read or understand a Sanskrit sentence. Therefore, while all sandhi changes are of interest,
