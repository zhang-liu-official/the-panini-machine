# The Determinstic Approach

Using Finite State methods: 

* A functional toolkit for morphological and phonological processing, application to a Sanskrit tagger \(Huet, 2005\)

> We present the Zen toolkit for morphological and phonological processing of natural languages. This toolkit is presented in literate programming style, in the Pidgin ML subset of the Objective Caml functional programming language. This toolkit is based on a systematic representation of finite state automata and transducers as decorated lexical trees. All operations on the state space data structures use the zipper technology, and a uniform sharing functor permits systematic maximum sharing as dags.
