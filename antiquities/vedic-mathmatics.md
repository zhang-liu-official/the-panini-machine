# Indian Mathematics

## Overview

Premodern Indian mathematics is generally bereft of proofs. The upside of that is a thoroughly constructive mathematics, meaning that mathematical facts get demonstrated through replicable procedures for carrying out concrete calculations. \(Kadvany 123, 2007\)

## The ´Sulba-sutras, or “Rules of the cord.”

Mathematical ideas were explored in more concrete detail in some of the ancillary works classified as Vedangas, “limbs of the Vedas,” mentioned in section 1.3—phonetics, grammar, etymology, metrics, astronomy and calendrics, and ritual practice. This section examines mathematics in Vedanga texts on ritual practice, which specified the details of performing the various ceremonies and sacrifices to the gods.

## On Infinity

अस्मिन् विकारः खहरे न राशौ अपि प्रविष्टेष्वपि निःसृतेषु \| 

बहुष्वपि स्याल्लयसृष्टिकाले’नन्ते’च्युते भूतगणेषु यद्वत् \|\| 

asmin vikāraḥ khahare na rāśau api praviṣṭeṣvapi niḥsṛteṣu \| 

bahuṣvapi syāllayasṛṣṭikāle’nante’cyute bhūtagaṇeṣu yadvat \|\| 

Just as at the period of destruction or creation of the worlds, though numerous orders of beings are absorbed or put forth, there is no change in the Infinite and Immutable God, so in the quantity which has zero for its divisor, there is no change, though many may be added or subtracted.
