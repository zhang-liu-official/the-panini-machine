## On Infinity

अस्मिन् विकारः खहरे न राशौ अपि प्रविष्टेष्वपि निःसृतेषु \| 

बहुष्वपि स्याल्लयसृष्टिकाले’नन्ते’च्युते भूतगणेषु यद्वत् \|\| 

asmin vikāraḥ khahare na rāśau api praviṣṭeṣvapi niḥsṛteṣu \| 

bahuṣvapi syāllayasṛṣṭikāle’nante’cyute bhūtagaṇeṣu yadvat \|\| 

Just as at the period of destruction or creation of the worlds, though numerous orders of beings are absorbed or put forth, there is no change in the Infinite and Immutable God, so in the quantity which has zero for its divisor, there is no change, though many may be added or subtracted.
