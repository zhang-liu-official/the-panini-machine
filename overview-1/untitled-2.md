# A possible scheme by Gerard Huet

Our scripts are actually close to the prakriyā explanations of the grammatical tradition - condensed invocations of the sūtras such as ḍukṛñ-ṇvul-su. Organizing them systematically in hierarchical manner would lead to some kind of abstract syntax of a somewhat esoteric programming language. It would be an interesting research program to exactly define this formal language, and use it as the conceptual basis for a software implementation of Pāṇini’s machine, with the following ingredients.

* Design of core microcode interpreter 'Pāṇinīyam'
* Design of a formal 'Prakriyā' machine language
* Compilation of Prakriyā scripts into Pāṇinīyam
* Decision procedure for recognizing a script as Paninian
* Design of a high-level language 'Vivakṣā' for expressing clear statements of the locutor's communication intention
* Writing of a compiler for Vivakṣā, generating Prakriyā scripts that are Paninian by construction

This tentative modular research program sketches a complete chain of production, from Vivakṣā statements to executable Paninian Prakriyā scripts.
