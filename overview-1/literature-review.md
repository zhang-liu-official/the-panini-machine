# Literature Review

## General State of Research

### \(Huet, 2019\)

> \[The attempts so far\] have discussed various problems in software representation of Paninian concepts, such as conflict resolution techniques. Some have succeeded in emulating vidhi portions of the grammar. But a comprehensive solution still seems far away. Actually, some scholars have expressed doubts about the whole endeavor. Peter Scharf explains difficult points in conflict resolution, which will need specific additional research. In his recent monograph “Modeling the Pāṇinian system of Sanskrit Grammar” \(Heidelberg University Press, 2019\), Anand Mishra expresses doubts at direct simulation of Aṣṭādhyāyī devices. Thus a full emulator of Pāṇini’s machine is still an open problem, but we see no theoretical impossibility at implementing a software implementation reasonably consistent with Aṣṭādhyāyī.

### \(Hellwig, 2016\)

> Although better explored than Middle Indo-Aryan languages \(see, for instance, Alfter and Knauth \(2015\)\), Sanskrit is still a low-resource language from the perspective of NLP. Research on morpho logical disambiguation concentrates on building analyzers with a high coverage of valid word forms \(Huet, 2005; Jha et al., 2009a; Mishra, 2009\). Frameworks for analyzing complete sentences either rely on Finite State methods \(Huet, 2006\), or a combination of rule-based and statistical methods \(Hellwig, 2015\).

## The-State-of-The-Art

### Digital Corpus

[Digital Corpus of Sanskrit \(DCS\) ](http://kjc-sv013.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/)developed at Heidelberg University by Oliver Hellwig, is the most advanced from the point of view of linguistic analysis, since it is fully annotated with morphological tags indexing a lexicon of stems. Its development involved several iterations of deep learning algorithms \(Hellwig 2009, 2015, 2016\). Covering at present 560,000 sentences, it is today the closest analogue for Sanskrit of the Perseus Digital Library for Greek and Latin corpus. \(Huet & Lankri, 2018\)
