# Introduction

## Overview

This site will serve as the documentation of a long-term study plan, which is largely a self-initiated passion project. In this project, I will attempt to use mathematical and computational methods to implement the Sanskrit grammatical system. The Sanskrit language was first formalized by the Indian linguistic Pāṇini \(पाणिनि\), and hence the name of this project. My tentative solution plan is to study the mechanics of Sanskrit and at the same time the relevant technical methods which I have broadly classified into the probabilistic approach and the deterministic approach.

I think of this project as a convergence of my interests. If we consider each of the disciplines concerned in this project a wooden plank, then it is fit to say that the current project is my ongoing experiment to locate the "center of gravity" where all these planks can achieve a balance off each other. 

## Significance

The significance of this project is two-fold. First, there is an increased interest in ancient Indian thought and traditions. However, many scholars are deterred by the lack of readily translated texts and the difficulties involved in learning Sanskrit. By implementing the grammatical system of Sanskrit, it is hoped that we can contribute to the task of Machine Translation in Sanskrit. Second and a more ambitious \(yet perhaps ambiguous\) theoretical significance is tied to the many peculiarities of the Sanskrit language. Most of the natural language processing research make use of probabilistic models to deal with the uncertainties in language, but Sanskrit, due to its highly systematic and in some sense deterministic nature, could pose some interesting challenges to this probabilistic way of training machines to recognize languages.
