# Introduction

## Overview

This site will serve as the documentation of a long-term study plan, which is largely a self-initiated passion project. In this project, I will attempt to use mathematical and computational methods to implement the Sanskrit grammatical system. The Sanskrit language was first formalized by the Indian linguistic Pāṇini \(पाणिनि\), and hence the name of this project. My tentative solution plan is to study the mechanics of Sanskrit and at the same time the relevant technical methods which I have broadly classified into the probabilistic approach and the deterministic approach.

I think of this project as a convergence of my interests. If we consider each of the disciplines concerned in this project a wooden plank stacked on top of each other, then the current project is my ongoing experiment to locate the "center of gravity" where a balanced state is achieved.

## Significance

The significance of this project is two-fold. First, there is an increased interest in ancient Indian thought and traditions. However, many scholars are deterred by the lack of readily translated texts and the difficulties involved in learning Sanskrit. By implementing the grammatical system of Sanskrit, it is hoped that we can contribute to the task of Machine Translation in Sanskrit. The second, and perhaps more ambitious significance is the potential contribution to the current theories in Natural Language Processing \(NLP\), and more generally Artificial Intelligence. Most of the methods in NLP make use of probabilistic models to deal with the uncertainties in languages. Unlike most of these commonly spoken languages, Sanskrit is very peculiar in that it is highly systematic and even deterministic in nature, which could lead to some interesting alternatives to this probabilistic way of training machines to recognize languages.
