# A possible plan by Gerard Huet

* Design of core microcode interpreter 'Pāṇinīyam'
* Design of a formal 'Prakriyā' machine language
* Compilation of Prakriyā scripts into Pāṇinīyam
* Decision procedure for recognizing a script as Paninian
* Design of a high-level language 'Vivakṣā' for expressing clear statements of the locutor's communication intention
* Writing of a compiler for Vivakṣā, generating Prakriyā scripts that are Paninian by construction
